      question: "What is the difference between CAR and EAR insurance?",
      answer: "Contractors' All Risks (CAR) insurance primarily covers civil engineering and building construction projects. Erection All Risks (EAR) focuses on machinery installation, electrical systems, and mechanical erection projects. CAR typically involves more structural work, while EAR involves more technical equipment assembly and testing."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I get coverage for an ongoing project?",
      answer: "While it's always best to secure insurance before a project begins, some insurers do offer coverage for ongoing projects after a thorough risk assessment. There may be exclusions for existing damage or a waiting period before coverage takes effect."
    },
    {
      question: "Does engineering insurance cover design errors?",
      answer: "Standard engineering insurance typically excludes losses resulting from faulty design or specifications. However, some policies offer Design Error Extension or Professional Indemnity coverage as an add-on to protect against design flaws or professional mistakes."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does the coverage last?",
      answer: "Engineering insurance policies typically cover the entire project period, from mobilization to completion. Many policies also include an extended maintenance period (usually 12 months) after project handover to cover defects that appear during this time."
