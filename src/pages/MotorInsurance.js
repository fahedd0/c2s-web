      question: "What's the difference between TPL and comprehensive motor insurance?",
      answer: "Third Party Liability (TPL) insurance is the minimum legal requirement in the UAE and covers damages you cause to other people's property or injuries to third parties. Comprehensive insurance includes TPL coverage plus protection for your own vehicle against accidents, theft, fire, and natural disasters."
    },
    {
      question: "How quickly can I get my motor insurance policy?",
      answer: "With our digital platform, most policies are issued instantly after payment is confirmed. You'll receive your digital insurance certificate immediately, which is valid for driving and registration purposes."
    },
    {
      question: "What factors affect my motor insurance premium?",
      answer: "Several factors influence your premium, including your vehicle's make, model, year, and value; your driving history and claims record; your age and driving experience; and optional coverage add-ons you select. Our comparison tool helps you understand how these factors impact pricing."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I transfer my no-claims discount from another insurer?",
      answer: "Yes, most insurance providers recognize no-claims discounts from other companies. You'll typically need to provide proof of your claims-free period from your previous insurer to benefit from continued discounts."
